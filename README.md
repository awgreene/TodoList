# Welcome
In this tutorial I followed the directions outlined by [Colt Steele]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/coltsteele/) in section 18 (Todo List Project) of the [The Web Developer Bootcamp]( https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview ) class.

# Why I Completed this Tutorial
With a history of backend development roles, I came to realize that to become a better engineer I needed to learn more about frontend development. To most individuals, the frontend is the product, and I was always nervous about sharing examples of my work publicly because of my limited frontend development skills. After hearing about [Brandon Morelli](https://github.com/bmorelli25/Become-A-Full-Stack-Web-Developer)'s experience, I decided that it was about time I learn more about frontend development.

# Overall Impression of this Tutorial
The tutorial drove home how useful jQuery is when building an interactive app. Many of the jQuery lessons leading to this exercise changed the CSS. styles of various elements, which was odd considering that many of the previous lessons praised doing so with CSS classes. Throughout this exercise, we returned to using CSS classes and really only used jQuery for DOM manipulation. Overall, I found that this exercise did a fantastic job pulling topics covered throughout the course together.
